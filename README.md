# FavoriteProjects
 Here are a few of my favorite projects that I have completed over the years!

## LLP Calculator (2025, Python/HTML5)
This was the first project I worked on in the workforce. I was given lead programmer for the job and was tasked with creating a frontend & backend to an application to calculate LLP for various plane parts. I ended up using python because it is what I was most familiar with, and it allowed me to bypass some online restrictions interms of grabbing data from a website.

## Quartet (2025, Many)
Quartet was my senior capstone project. It is a website templet that allows barbershops to advertise their barbers, hours, pricing, and availability to their customers. Along with my team of five, we worked in two week sprints across a semester to build, test, and produce a final product. Our website includes a client side frontend that allows clients to schedule appointments, learn about the shop and its barbers, order hair products, and leave reviews. Our website also includes a barber side frontend that allows barbers to customise the client side fronted, set their hours for either weekly or yearly, add, remove, or edit products, customise their displayed profile, and much more. Finally, all the information is stored in an SQL databes in InfinityFree, which is also where the website is hosted. Are goal was to make a nice interface for both the barbers and the clients that interact with the website, and we are very happy with how things turned out.

## ROS2 Soccer (2025, Python)
This was my final project with a ROS2 robot. We were tasked with creating an algorithm to allow our robot to play soccer against other teams. The startegy we used was defence. Our robot would start by searching for the red ball, and once it finds it, it will charge at it until it hits it. Once the robot makes contact, it looses vision of the red ball, and uses lidar to position itself in the center of the arena. THen it searches for our team's colored goal, and then charges it until it is close to the wall of the goal. Then the cycle repeats. With this strategy, we were able to place second in the class and never lost a game!

## ROS2 Sumo (2025, Python)
This was my first time working with a ROS2 robot. We were tasked with creating an algorithm for our robot to play a match of sumo against opposing teams. Which ever team touched the wall of the arena first lost. Our strategy was for our robot to drift forward and to the right, creating about 1/4 of a circle while also positioning the camera directly towards the side of the other robot. Then our robot searched for the orange tape on the robot, and charged for the center-most point of the orange that it sees. This was my first time implementing camera vision, and had a lot of fun working with the values!

## My First Website (2023, Many)
For one of my programming classes, I was task to make a website with various branching sites that would allow the user to complete different tasks. I had to use a ton of webprogramming languages, including HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, Roff, Shell, and Perl. I had a lot of fun customizing my website and learning how to use PHP.

## Vigenere Cipher Solver (2023, Python)
I was assigned the task to make a brute force vigenere cipher decryptor to simulate how a hacker can intercepot and decrypt encrypted messages. While it is not as efficient as I would have hoped for, I am still very proud of it since this was my first project oriented towards Ciber Security

## Sudoku Solver (2022, Python)
I was assigned the task to create a brute force puzzle solver that would return the solved sudoku puzzle. I had to solve a total of 5 puzzles using python.

## Hack WashU Submission (2022, Python)
My friend and I chose to make our first ever game in pygame together for HackWashU 2022. It was a lot of fun working together for the first time and I really enjopyed making all the pixel art and working on animation and UI. We made a game where the player controlled a diver that would go around and pick up trash and deliver them to a boat to help clean the ocean. We also add a cute little dolphin that once interacted with would follow the player around. While it has many flaws, I'm supper proud of how far we had come in the 48 hours we were given.

## Halloween Maze Solver (2021, Python)
This was my first ever puzzle solver, and to top it off it was Halloween themed! We were allowed to input the dimension of the maze, the starting position of Bob the Blob, and the maze itself into an input.txt. The maze itself used '#' as a wall, 'P' as a piece of candy, 'S' as a sidewalk, and '@' as a man hole than Bob could warp to. Using recursion, I would calculate how many pieces of candy Bob was able to eat, and his final path idecated by 'B'. I had a really fun time working on this and it really helped me understand how recursion works.

## Memory Match Game (2020, Java)
This was my first crack at java in High School, and for a final project I made a memory match game! It was challenging, but very fun. This was one of my first ever major projects in my coding journey.
